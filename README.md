You can use any technology you like, and it is down to you whether you use a command-line interface or a web interface for the process of generating and solving the puzzle.

**Don't forget** - the aim of the challenge is to show-off your skills writing clean, test-driven, well designed object-oriented code, rather than just to prove you can solve the problem. [This document](https://github.com/makersacademy/post_course/blob/master/Taking%20Your%20Coding%20Further.md) explains more, please re-read it before starting the challenge.

## Submitting your challenge

To start the challenge, fork this repository. Once you have finished, make sure you have added [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/) stats to your repository then submit a pull request. See if you can resolve as many [style-guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides) violations picked up by [Hound](https://houndci.com) as possible and your Code Climate score is above 3 and then one of the coaches will review your code. Good luck!
